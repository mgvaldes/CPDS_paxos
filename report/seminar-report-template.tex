\section{Introduction}

This assignment gave us the opportunity to learn and implement the \textit{Paxos} algorithm. This algorithm is a protocol for solving consensus between processes in a distributed system. Consensus consists in agreeing on a proposed value among a group of participants. In this particular case, we have a set of \textit{Proposers} that propose different values, to a set of \textit{Acceptors} until a single and unique value is agreed between all \textit{Proposers} and \textit{Acceptors}.

\section{Work done}

\textit{Source code files must be submitted together with this report. Present here any design decision required to understand your submitted code (if any).}

\section{Experiments}

\textit{Provide evidence of the experiments you did (e.g., use screenshots) and discuss the results you got. In addition, you may provide figures or tables with experimental results of the system evaluation. For each seminar, we will provide you with some guidance on which kind of evaluation you should do.}

\section{Open questions}

\textit{Try to answer all the open questions in the documentation. When possible, do experiments to support your answers.}

\section{Personal opinion}

\textit{Provide your personal opinion of the seminar, including whether it should be included in next year's course or not.}
